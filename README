parabola-arm-imagebuilder
=========================

this is a collection of scripts creating parabola arm images for use with qemu
with the goal of building parabola arm packages on these machines.

to create a new virtual machine, run
  $> sudo ./create.sh

the creation script makes use of several files and packages present on already
setup parabola development machines. if your setup is different, you might
have to modify the scripts accordingly.

Places the scripts check the host machine for configuration files are:
  /etc/makepkg.conf - for PACKAGER and GPGKEY
  ~/.gnupg ~/.ssh ~/.gitconfig - copied verbatim to the VM

The scripts assume that the following programs are available and in $PATH:
  qemu-img, qemu-system-arm
  wget
  parted
  mkfs.vfat, mkfs.ext4
  bsdtar
  scp, ssh, ssh-keygen
  pacman

The scripts also assume that you like vim :)

to open a shell into the created machine, run
  $> ./start.sh [path to created image]

you are logged in as user parabola with password parabola. passwordless sudo is
setup and the package tree and a build chroot are prepared. have fun. also
check out the .bashrc of the parabola user in the created virtual machine, for
batch build integration based on task-spooler.
