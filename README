parabola-imagebuilder
=====================

This is a collection of scripts creating parabola images for use with qemu.

image creation
--------------

To create a new virtual machine image, run
  $> sudo ./create.sh

The creation is influenced by the following environment variables:

 ARCH - the target architecture of the image. default: armv7h

 SIZE - the size of the root image. default: 64GiB

 MIRROR - the mirror used to pacstrap the image, anything valid in a `Server =`
          line can go here.
          default: https://redirector.parabola.nu/\$repo/os/\$arch}

The created images are stored in the build/ directory.


virtual machine start
---------------------

To boot a created virtual machine, run
  $> sudo ./boot.sh [path to created image]

The start.sh script assumes that you want a throwaway session, so it will start
the virtual machine in snapshot mode, and changes during the session will be
discarded.
